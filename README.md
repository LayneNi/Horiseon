# Horiseon

## Description

This project is a refactor of the Horiseon company webpage. The purpose of this project was to update and organize the code to run smoothly. I accomplished this by using semantic HTML and by reordering/condensing the HTML and CSS. This refactor makes the website more accessable because the code is now much easier to interpret by screen readers and other assitance devices as well as for other developers in the future. Making a webpage more accesable is important because it makes the site more inclusive as well as improves the webpages standings on search engines such as Google.
